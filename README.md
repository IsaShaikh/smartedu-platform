## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 21 or later
- Node.js v18 or later
- A running PostgreSQL database
- A Cloudinary account (for user profile image uploads)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd learningpath
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - In `src/main/resources/`, rename `application-example.properties` to `application.properties`.
    - Fill in your PostgreSQL database details (`spring.datasource.url`, `username`, `password`).
    - Add your Cloudinary API details (`cloudinary.cloud_name`, `api_key`, `api_secret`).
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. The first time it runs, the `DataSeeder` will populate the database with fake users and courses.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd learningpath-dashboard
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
